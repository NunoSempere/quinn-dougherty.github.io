# I think everyone should read these

## [Build Your Own Lisp in C](http://buildyourownlisp.com/)
This book leveled me up a lot. If you're beginner to intermediate at software and you're looking new avenues, I hope you complete it. 

## [The Sequences](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality:_From_AI_to_Zombies)
The most important thing about this book is its _preimage_, in other words, the books it points you to (including ITILA, Superforecasters, and many others)

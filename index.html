<p>Hi! I'm excited about software engineering, data engineering, and functional programming.</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer with over a year of experience in languages including Python, Java, and Haskell. Most of my Python projects are Machine Learning related. </p>

<p>I know object oriented programming, functional programming, and databases. I can spin up a REST api or microservice on command. I know predictive modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and data analytics.</p>

<p>At every subproblem, I seek opportunities to write small, pure functions. Compositionality is paramount. I lint and typecheck my code as much as possible, because I've experienced strong ROI on code quality and bug-finding. I aspire to be thoughtful, opinionated, and consistent every time I have to decide between functions or classes, between recursive or iterative, and between stateful or stateless.</p>

<p>I'm happy to do any backend work or devops.</p> 

<p>When I'm not writing Python, I'm writing Haskell or Coq. In Coq, I've automated parts of real & complex analysis.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://triplebyte.com/certificate/ZjoW4Zy">Triplebyte certification</a> is in Machine Learning Engineering and I'd be thrilled to implement, deploy, and maintain your models! </p>


<h1>Open Source / Activism</h1>

<h2><a href="https://social-media-analysis-toolkit.herokuapp.com/">Social Media Analysis Toolkit</a></h2>
Make datasets and visualizations of a time series of activity on reddit and twitter. 
(<a href="https://gitlab.com/smat-project/social-media-analysis-toolkit/">View code</a>)
Our targeted userbase is researchers and activists who specialize in disinformation, radicalization, and election meddling. 
Our app queries public social media data and serves visualizations and datasets.
<ul>
	<li>Built out from greenfield an app that went on to be contributed to by a team of 3 people.</li>
	<li>Implemented Changepoint Analysis into a user-friendly tool.</li>
	<li>Configured code style enforcement in CI with CD from GitLab to Heroku.</li>
	<li>Unit tests</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://penn-chime.phl.io/">COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics</a></h2>
	Discrete-time SIR modeling of infections and recovery. 
<ul>
	<li>PRs included increase in code quality/modularity and mission-critical mathematical/epidemiological content from notebook to production.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/codeforphilly/prevention-point">Prevention Point Unified Reporting System</a></h2>
	This project would work to migrate all of the disparate data sources into one system, make a UI that allows Prevention Point to access all participant data in one system, and increase the ease with which program coordinators can evaluate and monitor activities.
<ul>
	<li>Wrote code to generate fake data for a Django app w Faker.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Fun Facts about me</h1>
<ul>
	<li>I've been grinding math and code since 2016, because that's around the time I started thinking it could change the world</li>
	<li>In another timeline, I was an improvisor, concert organizer, and composer. 
There were lots of failures, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6ZhOFhqtA4">here</a> is one of the successes.</li>
	<li>I also worked in the film industry, which taught me about managing teams and preparing for the worst.</li>
</ul>

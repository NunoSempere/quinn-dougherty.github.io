<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>My House</h2>
Let homeowners view valuation
<i>scikit-learn | agile practices | OOP | pandas | aws</i>
<ul>
	<li>Automating loading and cleaning so rolling datadumps from multiple sources doesnâ€™t slow down analysis, feature engineering, and training. [view code]</li>
	<li>Logging missingness and making motivated imputation choices from analysis and experiment.</li>
	<li>Agile for collaborative data science in github and trello.</li>
	<li>Deployment of an API service on that takes json requests, deserializes a pretrained model, and computes predictions on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. [view code]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prescriptive Possibilities</h2>
Report probability of protein-ligand bind
<i>Semi-supervised learning | TF-IDF | aws | pandas </i>
<ul>
	<li>TF-IDF vectorizations </li>
	<li>Semi-supervised classification on positive-unlabeled data.</li>
	<li>Deployment of serialized model to elastic beanstalk</li>
</ul>

I've been grinding math and code since 2016, because that's around the time I started thinking it could change the world. 

In another timeline, I was an improvisor, concert organizer, and composer. There were lots of failures, here's one of the successes.

I also completed many questlines in the film industry-- they gave me a healthy pessimism, I find preparing for the worst to be very natural and almost relaxing in a real way.
